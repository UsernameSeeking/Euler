# Euler
Euler methods to solve ODEs

## Setup the environment
`From this point, the word "lib" will be used as "library" and "libs" as "libraries"`

Necessary libs for this program are listed below:
* sympy
* matplotlib
* wolframalpha (This lib is used to get the exact solution from Wolfram Alpha)

### Install libs
To install these libs, run these commands in terminal:

```bash
pip install sympy matplotlib wolframalpha
```

### Arrange folder
> For the code to run normally, all files should be placed in the same folder
